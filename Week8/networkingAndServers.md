## Notes:

- I.S.P graph - each dot is a node

- Peer-to-Peer Network - does not go through server

- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

- Cache - used by website to to decrease load time

- Testing Tools:
  - found in Network Tab of Browser Devtools
  - Ping: check to see if you can get response from server
  - Curl: request data from server. used tor testing API
  - Postman: made for testing APIs (curl wrapper)

  - DNS (Domain Name System)
    - IP address - unique for each machine
      - servers have IP addresses too

- Async -- does not block
  - sync -- makes thigns do one at a time
    - if something takes really long to load, can't do anything else until it finishes
  - can do stuff on the side while waiting for content to load
